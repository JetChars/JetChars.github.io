MicroServices
=============



The microservice architectural style [1] is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.[mar2014]


I think the style 'microservices' is a good architechture  for distributed software.

- default style for building enterprise applications


- RESTful api for client/server communications
- AMQP for communications between services
